CSC573: Internet Protocols
Project 2: TCP Analysis

Author: Devi Krishnan (Unity ID dhkrishn)

Language: C++
This code was executed/tested on an Ubuntu 19 virtual machine on a Mac OS.

Execution:
1. Download and extract the zipped "project2" folder.
2. Change into your ns-3-dev directory and copy the file "project2/tcp_dhkrishn.cc" into "ns-3-dev/scratch" in order to run the file.
3. Assuming you are still in the ns-3-dev/ directory, type the following into the terminal:

./waf --run scratch/tcp_dhkrishn

Packages/Dependencies:
I installed and ran ns-3 by cloning the latest release from the following URL:

https://gitlab.com/nsnam/ns-3-dev/-/tree/master/src/internet/model

Cloning directly from this master branch of ns-3 should install all the packages you will need to run the code.
